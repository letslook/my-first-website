    What he arrived home he went straight away went in his room and said screaming “WHAT HAVE I DONE” he was gust going to press the red button on the back that would have reset his life.
    He thought for a minute would he have liked if there weren’t any of his family there to support him for all his life?
    Would he have liked to give up to the weal and never use it again? He thought for a minute or two but then he decided........
    He would give up to the weal and would keep his family with him for the rest of his life.
    Family is more important than ever!! ❤
