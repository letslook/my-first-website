    He closed himself in the bathroom, thinking that if his mother would enter he would tell here what he thought about his life: he doesn’t like it because he is to much under pressure.
He started to watch a bit his iPad, he didn’t opened for 5 years, he started playing some games that he found wile he was eating some biscuits that he had stolen from the kitchen, he had never done something like that!!
IT WAS SO AWESOME!!!!😎🤩
But in that exact moment his MOM came in and ruined all of the good atmosphere that there was “WHAT ARE YOU DOING, I PROHIBITED YOU THAT UGLY IPAD UNTIL YOU ARE 19 YOU NEED TO CONCENTRATE MORE ON STUDYING AND NOT PAYING WITH THAT IPAD!!” said his mom.
He wanted to shout to her what he had thought but he was to much afraid of here.
“Sorry mom I didn’t now what I was doing, i promise you that this will never happen anymore.” he siad
From that exact day Marco was more than concentrate at school than ever, but sometimes he would hid under the bed and play a bit on the iPad.
The rest of his life he spent it studying and getting good grades, but deep in his heart, he would have changed his life in a more free one.
