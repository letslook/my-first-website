    Once upon a time there was this little boy called Marco, that didn’t like school but he did his best to get good grades and do well, he did it for his one education but even for his mother that hated when he got bad grades.
One day he went to a to a toy shop because he needed to buy something for his little sister Emily
He entered this shop and bought the toy that his sister wanted so much but suddenly he saw a weal, the game was called THE MAGIC WEAL, he straight way asked his mother if he could buy it for him, his mother hesitated but at the end he bought it for him, Marco didn’t now why he needed to buy a weal but he felt very attractive from it.
He went home and started playing with it, until it arrived a message on his iPad, it was from school and it said......
That he got 4/8 he was desperate, he didn’t like to get bad grades, so he said “I wished I could have better grades!” But for accident he spinned the weal AND THE COLORED THAT APPEARED TO HIM WAS blue, in that game was the lucky color.
He didn’t know that that weal could express all the different types of wishes he had, if he would have gotten blue or pink.
After a minute it arrived an notification from the teacher that said : I am sorry Marco but you grades have changed know your grade isn’t more 4/8 but its 8/8
He was so exited that he started to scream from happiness.
All his family was happy from his grade so they did a big party, that night Marco after the party wanted seriously to start to play with his weal, he started reading the instruction that said : “you need to be very attentive with this game, because it could be good if you are lucky but if you are fortunate it could be very dangerous, it could change completely your life.”
In that exact moment Marco was a bit scared of that game but he started playing anyway, but suddenly he saw something else on the instructions that said: “it you get the blue your wish will become true, if you get the black your wish will become he opposite and if you get the yellow someone of important for you will desapere without saying nothing, and last but not lest there is the pink that will express two times your wish, and at the back of the weal there is a red button and if you press it it would cancel all the good and bad things that happened with the weal. He said that it would be impossible that this would happen, but he wanted to try.....
He needed first to say his dream and then spin the weal, he wished for something of not that important “I want to eat my favourite dinner” he
spinned the weal and got black😭😭.
In the instructions it said that black would be the opposite of his dream, he thought that was impossible but in that exact moment his mother said “Hi lovely I now that you hate pasta with spinach but that’s all we have in the fridge.”
His wish become true, he got black and the dream become the opposite!!
For days and day after that he ate pasta with spinach he always played with the weal and got always pink or blue, he was very very lucky, but one day he spinner the weal and he got the ugliest color in that game, it was yellow. He couldn’t believe that anyone of his family would despaired, he wasn't shore of how it worked because he never got that color but he new it would be something of bad.
For days it didn’t happen nothing but he continued getting yellow, he was desperate.
One day when school was finished his mom or dad would come and get him, but for hours and hours anyone came and get him, until the last moment that his baby sitter came running towards him. She said that his mother, his dad and his sister were gone!!!
