       Once upon a time there was this little boy called Marco, he had a sister called Emily that had 4 years old, a mom called oe and a Dad called Alessandro.
Marco didn’t like school but his mom would force him to go, Marco had two best friend that didn’t like school either but hey tried there best to do well.
Saturday was the day of only mom and Marco, they could do whatever they wanted.
They entered in a beautiful shop, it was new, his mom said that he could get something that he really liked.
Marco thought of a beautiful Lego to build but then he saw a weal he got in LOVE with it.
He got the weal and went straight away to pay it, his mom didn’t now that he liked weals but so he asked him “are you
sure that you want to get this and not one of the Legos?” o I am sure said Marco.
When Marco arrive home he needed to do his homework but he didn’t want to, he mother said that he didn’t do his omework he would have talked away the new game from him for a week.
He did them in silence but when he finished them it was time to go to bed, he was so angry. The next day at school he aid to his friends that he bought a new toy they were all so excited and they asked if they could see it. Marco said that
He forgot at home but one day they could come and see it. That afternoon he went home, he didn’t have homework so
he went to play with the weal, the first thing that he did was to get the instructions and read them loudly.
"you need to be very attentive with this game, because it could be good if you are lucky but if you are fortunate it could be ery dangerous, it could change completely your life.” Marco continue ed reading “it you get the blue your wish will
become true, if you get the black your wish will become he opposite and if you get the yellow someone of important for ou will desapere without saying nothing, and last but not lest there is the pink that will express two times your wish, and t the back of the weal there is a red button and if you press it it would cancel all the good and bad things that happened
with the weal.
marco wasn’t afraid and right away he said his wish “ I wish that in my previous assessment I did very very good.” He
spin ed the weal and got BLUE he was so exited if the weal did was as they described he would be the most fortunate oy of the world. But he didn’t remember that there were all of the other colors too!!
