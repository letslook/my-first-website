    He decided that he wouldn’t show it to his friends until he will be sure that the weal was magical.
    After a few minutes it arrived a notification from school it said that in his previous assessment he got 7/8!!!
    “IT NEVER HAPPENED” he shouted, all his family congratulated with him, they were all so happy.
    Marco for days and days he continued to have a good grade because on the magic weal he always got blue.
    One day his friend asked “what method do you use to get always good grades?” Marco said that was a secret, but he invited them to a Pajama party to his house, after a long night Alex (one of his two friend that he invited at the pajama party) asked “what on earth is that game?” It was the magic weal, Marco didn’t want to show it to them but he couldn’t tell lies to his best friends.
    “ it’s a magic weal” is friend laughing said that that was impossible. Marco didid’t like them saying like this so he started playing “I want that my next grade that will arrive will be perfect!” He’s pinned the weal and got has normal BLUE he was happy because he would show to his friends that this isn’t a joke.
    After a few minutes a grade arrive it said that he had got 7/8 in Italian.
    His friends couldn’t believe it it was real, it’s expressed every wish that you asked, Marco said that you need to be very careful with it because every color has a meaning and something of bad can happen.
    “ can we try it Marco” Marco said yes
    They tried it, and wished for good grades, they yellow, Marco was very happy but a bit jealous too because they wished for good breeds and got yellow.
    The next day at school his friend got 8/8 and he got 7/8, he was more than jealous now, that was his game and he could play with it
    only!! 😤😡
    His friends asked if they could play again with the weal, Marco said absolutely NO, he wanted to keep it for himself. In the weeks that arrive his friend became angrier and angrier and Marco become more lonelier than ever, he became sad and isolated. He started to get yellow in the magic weal, but nothing happened. After day his dad diapered, even his friend weren’t coming anymore to school, he was now really really lonely....
    After days he remembers that there was a button on the back of the weal that would refresh all of what happened, but he didn’t found if because in the instructions it said that if you aren’t generous or kind with how you love the button will go away FOR EVER!! Now Marco will be lonely and sad for ever because he didn’t respect the rules of the game and because he didn’t help his friends when they asked!
